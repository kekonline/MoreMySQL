-- Online shop

-- Use foreign keys
-- Keep it fairly simple (unless you really want to get stuck into it)

â€” List these things:
-- product
-- product categories
-- customers
-- record all sales including time of sale
-- Don't use enum for any potentially long lists, like products or categories

-- Write a join query that lists all the sales and all associated information
-- Create some join queries that retrieve other information; whatever you can think up (e.g a list of products by number of sales, top selling product first)
