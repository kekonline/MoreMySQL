1. Using any table, write a query that produces the following output, querying the number of rows in the table.

'Total: 5 records'

Modify the query so that it only adds the "s" to "records" if there is some number of records other than 1. For example:

'Total: 0 records'
'Total: 5 records'
'Total: 1 record'

2. Using a table with a date column, format the dates in this format:

'31st of January, 2015 (Saturday)'

Set a variable to the value of one of the dates retrieved from this table, in this format.

Now format the date contained in the variable back into a date object.
